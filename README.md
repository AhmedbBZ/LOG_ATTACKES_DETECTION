# LOG_ATTACKES_DETECTION

## Overview
This project is designed to detect and analyze attack patterns in log files using machine learning techniques. It includes scripts, notebooks, and models for preprocessing log data, training classifiers, and evaluating detection performance.

## Features
- Log data preprocessing
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
- Pre-trained models and vectorizers
- Web application interface (if applicable)

## Project Structure
- `application.py`: Main Python application script
- `app.ipynb`, `ML.ipynb`, `Projet.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model development
- `log_dataset_Attackes_detection.csv`, `log_dataset.csv`: Log datasets for training and testing
- `model_finale.pkl`, `vectorizer.pkl`: Saved ML model and vectorizer
- `main.js`: JavaScript file (possibly for web interface)
- `static/`, `templates/`: Web application assets and templates
- `package.json`: Node.js dependencies (if web interface is used)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/AhmedbBZ/LOG_ATTACKES_DETECTION.git
   ```
2. Install required Python packages:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application or open notebooks for analysis.

## Usage
- Use the Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model training.
- Run `application.py` to execute the main detection pipeline.
- If a web interface is provided, start the server and access the dashboard.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)
- Node.js (if using the web interface)
